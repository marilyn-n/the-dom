People of <b>MARS</b>, your attention please.

This is <i>Captain Marvel </i> of the
Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council.

As you will no doubt be aware, the plans
for development of the outlying regions
of the Galaxy require the building of a
hyperspatial express route through your
star system, and regrettably your planet
is one of those scheduled for destruction.

The process will take slightly less than
1 Sec.

Thank you.
